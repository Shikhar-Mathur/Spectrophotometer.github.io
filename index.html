                Spectrophotometer is based on the photometric technique which states that when a beam of incident light of intensity (I <sub> o </sub>) passes through a solution, a part of the incident light is reflected (I <sub>r</sub>), a part is absorbed (I <sub>a</sub>) and rest of the light is transmitted (I <sub>t</sub>)
                <br>
                <br>
                Thus,<br> <br>
                     I<sub>o</sub> = I<sub>r</sub> + I<sub>a</sub> + I<sub>t</sub> <br> <br>

                    <div class="princiexplain">
                        The principle of the Spectrophotometer is based on Beer-Lambert’s law which states that the amount of light absorbed by a solution is directly proportional to the concentration of the solution and the length of a path through the solution.

                    Where, <br>
                    A = Absorbance / Optical density of solution <br>

             <ul>
            <li>When using a Spectrophotometer, it is calibrated first by using the standard solutions of the known concentration of the solute that has to be determined in the test solution. For this, the standard solutions are filled in the Cuvettes and placed in the Cuvette holder in the spectrophotometer.</li> <br>
            <li>There is a ray of light with a certain wavelength that is specific for the assay, which is directed towards the solution. Before reaching the solution the ray of light passes through a series of the diffraction grating, prism, and mirrors. These mirrors are used for navigation of the light in the spectrophotometer and the prism splits the beam of light into different wavelengths and the diffraction grating allows the required wavelength to pass through it and reaches the Cuvette containing the standard or Test solutions. It analyses the reflected light and compares it with a predetermined standard solution. </li> <br> 
            <li>When the monochromatic light (light of one wavelength) reaches the Cuvette some of the light is reflected, some part of the light is absorbed by the solution and the remaining part is transmitted through the solution which falls on the photodetector system. The photodetector system measures the intensity of transmitted light and converts it into the electrical signals that are sent to the galvanometer.</li> <br>
            <li>The galvanometer measures the electrical signals and displays them in digital form. That digital representation of the electrical signals is the absorbance or optical density of the solution analysed.</li> <br>
            <li> If the absorption of the solution is higher than there will be more light absorbed by the solution and if the absorption of the solution is low then more lights will be transmitted through the solution which affects the galvanometer reading and corresponds to the concentration of the solute in the solution.</li> <br>

                    <li> Take out the desiccant in the sample chamber before starting the machine. It is forbidden to open the sample chamber cover during the self-checking process of the instrument.</li> <br>
                    <li> The solution in the cuvette should be 2/3～4/5 of the height of the cuvette, and it should not be too full to prevent the liquid from overflowing and corroding the instrument.</li> <br>
                    <li> Keep the cuvette clean during the measurement, and wipe the liquid droplets on the wall with lens cleaning paper.</li> <br>
                    <li> Do not pinch the translucent surface with your hands. When measuring the ultraviolet wavelength, a quartz cuvette is required.</li> <br>
                    <li> After the experiment, pour out the solution in the cuvette, then rinse the cuvette with distilled water or organic solvent until it is clean, and dry it upside down. </li> <br>
